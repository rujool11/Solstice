use vite to create react app, npm create vite@latest

IMP: this is only for create-react-app, not vite 
to connect frontend ( port 5173 ) to backend ( port 5000 )
add proxy : http://127.0.0.1:5000 to package.json of frontend

for vite, => 
in viteconfig, add 
 server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://127.0.0.1:5000',
        changeOrigin: true,
        rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, 'api')
      }
    }
 }

for client side routing, use react-router-dom
wrap main app in BrowserRouter


IMP-->
in App.jsx, routing for / and /chats, -> if exact not used, then homePage and chatPage
both will be rendered, since /chats includes / route, thus we use exact in route for /

install axios to make api calls to backend (in App.jsx)
need to use async to use await, thus make it an async function

useEffect hook, which runs when the component has been rendered for the first time
used to perform side effects in function components
takes args useEffect(xFunction, dependencyArray)
xFunction is the function that will run and perform the side effect
dependencyArray is array of dependencies that determine when the xFunction should be re-executed
xFunction only re-executed when one of the values in the array changes between renders
empty dependencyArray => only runs after initial render
no dependencyArray => runs after every render


useState hook, returns a state variable and setState function to update the state
takes initial state as input, which can also be a function that calculates state, as well
as a variable/object

chakraUI -> Box works the same as div

postDetails -> changed to e.target.values[0], as it will then accept only the first 
file in cause of multiple files posted

cloud name, account details etc from cloudinary
